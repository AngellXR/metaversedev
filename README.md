## About

Metaverse.dev is an open source project dedicated to helping people become new or improved metaverse creators. AngellXR is incubating this effort collaboratively with other creators, maintainers, and teams. This effort recently re-kicked-off, and we hope you will join us in making it a success. 

### How to get involved 

We meet on the second* Monday of every month at 21:05 UTC :calendar: add these events to your [google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NDMwbjVvNm1oMnN2ajZvZm9oZzA1djUyNDBfMjAyMjA0MDRUMjEwNTAwWiBqZXNzZUBhbmdlbGx4ci5jb20&tmsrc=jesse%40angellxr.com&scp=ALL)

We use Github to self organize around github [milestones](https://github.com/AngellXR/metaversedev/milestones) and [discussions](https://github.com/AngellXR/metaversedev/discussions).

One of our key assets for this effort is metaverse.dev, which we believe should be used for an open source knowledge sharing resource. How can we make it easier for people to achieve their goal of becoming a Metaverse creator? How can we share what we have learned, and guide others along the way? How can we ensure that the content we share is sustainably produced, and managed by the community rather than a small bottleneck? 

## :bulb: Why are we here? 

We want to organically create value by helping others become Metaverse creators and contributors. We want to find creative ways to sustain ourselves. We want to create incentive structures that align with peoples values. 

People need something that keeps them focused, and moving forward on their mission to get involved with the Metaverse. It can be easy to run into a roadblock, and get deflated or distracted. We want to make achieving the goal of becoming or improving as a Metaverse creator more attainable. We want to create incentive structures that align with peoples values. 

Furthermore, we should strive to deliver this message with minimal fluff or bullshit. The goal should be to enable folks to discover solutions and make effective choices, using _inclusive language_. 

Eventually we will have more options for metaverse contributors. Beyond developers, there will be metaverse designers, metaverse modelers, and even metaverse entertainers. Shops, services, SaaS. 


## :woman: Who is impacted by our work? 

- People building the Metaverse 
- People who want to become Metaverse developers 
- People who want to create Metaverse products
- People who want to share their knowledge with others 
- We are indirectly helping other groups in the Metaverse seeking future hires, by effectively manufacturing metaverse talent. 

## :dart: Goals: What do we hope to accomplish? (TBD)

### Objective I: Increase the number of Metaverse contributors and creators. 
### Objective II: Organically create sustainable value
Encourage people to tell their stories! How to use V-Sekai, how to become a Webaverse Developer, etc. 
### Objective III: Launch first curriculums*
